### 4. Stay Updated
- Follow industry blogs and podcasts
- Read case studies from major tech companies
- Participate in system design communities

### 5. Focus on Trade-offs
- Every design decision has pros and cons
- Understand the context for each choice
- Be able to justify your decisions

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Engineering
- Start simple and add complexity as needed
- Don't design for scale you don't need
- Focus on the problem at hand
