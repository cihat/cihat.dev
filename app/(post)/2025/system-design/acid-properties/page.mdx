# ACID Properties

ACID properties are fundamental concepts in database systems that ensure reliable transaction processing. The acronym ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.

## Atomicity

Atomicity ensures that a transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations within the transaction succeed, or none of them do.

**Example:**
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100 WHERE id = 1;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
```

If either UPDATE fails, both operations are rolled back, maintaining data integrity.

## Consistency

Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another. The database must satisfy all constraints and rules before and after the transaction.

**Example:**
- Account balances cannot be negative
- Foreign key constraints must be maintained
- Business rules must be enforced

## Isolation

Isolation ensures that concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other. Each transaction appears to be executed in isolation, even when multiple transactions are running simultaneously.

**Isolation Levels:**
1. **Read Uncommitted** - Lowest isolation, allows dirty reads
2. **Read Committed** - Prevents dirty reads
3. **Repeatable Read** - Prevents non-repeatable reads
4. **Serializable** - Highest isolation, prevents phantom reads

## Durability

Durability ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the event of a system failure (power loss, crash, etc.).

**Implementation:**
- Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
- Checkpointing
- Backup and recovery mechanisms

## ACID vs BASE

While ACID focuses on consistency and reliability, BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) prioritizes availability and performance over strict consistency.

**When to use ACID:**
- Financial transactions
- Inventory management
- User authentication
- Critical business operations

**When to use BASE:**
- Social media feeds
- Analytics data
- Caching layers
- High-traffic web applications

## Trade-offs

- **Performance**: ACID transactions are slower due to locking and logging
- **Scalability**: ACID databases are harder to scale horizontally
- **Complexity**: Implementing ACID properties adds complexity to the system
- **Reliability**: ACID provides strong guarantees for data integrity

## Real-world Examples

1. **Banking Systems**: All financial transactions must be ACID compliant
2. **E-commerce**: Order processing requires ACID properties
3. **Inventory Management**: Stock updates must be atomic and consistent
4. **User Registration**: Account creation must be atomic and durable
