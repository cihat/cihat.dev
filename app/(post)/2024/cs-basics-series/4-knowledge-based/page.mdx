# Introduction and Big O Notation

What I'm doing here is segmenting the topics from the book `Cracking The Coding Interview` and cross-referencing them with the corresponding page numbers in the book `Data Structures & Algorithms in C++` to determine their relevance.

### **Cracking The Coding Interview** 👉🏻 [158-190]
  - C and C++
  - Java
  - Databases
  - Threads and Locks
