# Introduction and Big O Notation

What I'm doing here is segmenting the topics from the book `Cracking The Coding Interview` and cross-referencing them with the corresponding page numbers in the book `Data Structures & Algorithms in C++` to determine their relevance.

### **Cracking The Coding Interview** 👉🏻 [88-111]
  - Arrays and Strings
  - Linked Lists
  - Stacks and Queues
  - Trees and Graphs

### **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++** 👉🏻 [103-?]
