# Introduction and Big O Notation

What I'm doing here is segmenting the topics from the book `Cracking The Coding Interview` and cross-referencing them with the corresponding page numbers in the book `Data Structures & Algorithms in C++` to determine their relevance.

### **Cracking The Coding Interview** 👉🏻 [112-157]
  - Bit Manipulation
  - Math and Logic Puzzles
  - Object-Oriented Design
  - Recursion and Dynamic Programming
  - System Design and Scalability
  - Sorting and Searching
  - Testing

### **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++** 👉🏻 [1-98(OOP), ?]
