For a long time, I have been grappling with confusion regarding my personal development path, exploring various areas of software such as iOS, Rust, Go, C++, and more. 
Last night and today, I made the decision to step back a bit. During this reflection, I came to the realization that my approach to development ambitions was flawed. 
Understanding that not everything can be pursued simultaneously, I acknowledged the need to solidify my foundational knowledge first. 
Therefore, I decided to let go of my scattered efforts and focus on strengthening my fundamentals.

Similarly, in my journey of self-development, I've come to recognize the importance of building a solid foundation. 
Without a robust base, my efforts to explore diverse areas of software were akin to constructing a fragile structure. 
Now, my focus is on reinforcing my fundamentals, ensuring a stable groundwork for my future endeavors.

[OpenSource Society University - CS](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science)<br/>
[Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)<br/>
I found some insightful ideas within the repository, particularly, [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) caught my attention and provided valuable enlightenment.üëâüèª

## List and order of topics in the series

I will structure and prioritize the content based on the chapters outlined in the book `Cracking The Coding Interview`, aligning with the sequence presented therein. 
Subsequently, I'll correspondingly address the relevant subjects delineated in the book `Data Structures & Algorithms in C++`.
You can access the grades for each section from the links provided in the list below.
