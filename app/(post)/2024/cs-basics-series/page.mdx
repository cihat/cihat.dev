for a long time, i have been grappling with confusion regarding my personal development path, exploring various areas of software such as ios, rust, go, c++, and more. 
last night and today, i made the decision to step back a bit. during this reflection, i came to the realization that my approach to development ambitions was flawed. 
understanding that not everything can be pursued simultaneously, i acknowledged the need to solidify my foundational knowledge first. 
therefore, i decided to let go of my scattered efforts and focus on strengthening my fundamentals.

<blockquote>
  if the foundation of the house is not strong, the roof will rise in vain.
</blockquote>

similarly, in my journey of self-development, i've come to recognize the importance of building a solid foundation. 
without a robust base, my efforts to explore diverse areas of software were akin to constructing a fragile structure. 
now, my focus is on reinforcing my fundamentals, ensuring a stable groundwork for my future endeavors.

i found some insightful ideas within the repository, particularly, [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13) caught my attention and provided valuable enlightenment.üëâüèª

i will structure and prioritize the content based on the chapters outlined in the book `cracking the coding interview`, aligning with the sequence presented therein. 
subsequently, i'll correspondingly address the relevant subjects delineated in the book `data structures & algorithms in c++`.
you can access the grades for each section from the links provided in the list below.
