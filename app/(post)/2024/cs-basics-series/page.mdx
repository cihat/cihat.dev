For a long time, I have been grappling with confusion regarding my personal development path, exploring various areas of software such as iOS, Rust, Go, C++, and more. 
Last night and today, I made the decision to step back a bit. During this reflection, I came to the realization that my approach to development ambitions was flawed. 
Understanding that not everything can be pursued simultaneously, I acknowledged the need to solidify my foundational knowledge first. 
Therefore, I decided to let go of my scattered efforts and focus on strengthening my fundamentals.

Similarly, in my journey of self-development, I've come to recognize the importance of building a solid foundation. 
Without a robust base, my efforts to explore diverse areas of software were akin to constructing a fragile structure. 
Now, my focus is on reinforcing my fundamentals, ensuring a stable groundwork for my future endeavors.
