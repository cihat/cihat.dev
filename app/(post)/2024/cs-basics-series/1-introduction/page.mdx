## Introduction and Big O Notation

What I'm doing here is segmenting the topics from the book `Cracking The Coding Interview` and cross-referencing them with the corresponding page numbers in the book `Data Structures & Algorithms in C++` to determine their relevance.

###  **Cracking The Coding Interview** 👉🏻 [2-87]
  - The Interview Process
  - Behind the Scenes
  - Special Situations
  - Before the Interview
  - Behavioral Questions
  - Big O Notation
  - Technical Questions
  - The Offer and Beyond
  - Interview Questions

### **Data Structures & Algorithms in C++** 👉🏻 [153-192]
  - Analysis Tools(Chapter 4)
    - 4.1 The Seven Functions Used in This Book
    - 4.2 Analysis of Algorithms
    - 4.3 Simple Justification Techniques
    - 4.4 Exercises
