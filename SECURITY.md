# Security & Performance Improvements

## 🔐 Security Fixes Applied

### 1. **Redis Credentials Protection**
- ✅ Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed Redis credentials
- ✅ All Redis operations now go through server-side API routes
- ✅ Client-side Redis access completely removed

### 2. **Rate Limiting**
- ✅ Added rate limiting to claps API (10 requests/minute per IP)
- ✅ Added rate limiting to views API (5 requests/minute per IP)
- ✅ Returns 429 status code when rate limit exceeded

### 3. **Input Validation**
- ✅ Score parameter clamped between 1-5 (prevents negative/huge values)
- ✅ Post ID validation before any Redis operation
- ✅ Proper error handling with fallback values

### 4. **Server-Side Only Operations**
- ✅ All increment operations happen server-side
- ✅ Client can only read/write through controlled API endpoints
- ✅ No direct database access from client

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. **Build Performance**
- ✅ Disabled sourcemaps in production (`productionBrowserSourceMaps: false`)
- ✅ Webpack devtool disabled for production builds
- ✅ Added `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=4096'` to build script
- ✅ Optimized package imports for better tree-shaking
- ✅ Updated moduleResolution to 'bundler' for faster TypeScript compilation

### 2. **Code Splitting**
- ✅ Optimized webpack splitChunks configuration
- ✅ Separate vendor and common chunks
- ✅ Deterministic module IDs for better caching

### 3. **Image Optimization**
- ✅ Configured deviceSizes and imageSizes
- ✅ Set minimumCacheTTL to 60 seconds
- ✅ WebP and AVIF format support

### 4. **TypeScript Configuration**
- ✅ Target set to ES2022 for better performance
- ✅ Module resolution set to 'bundler'
- ✅ Excluded unnecessary directories from compilation

## 🚨 Important Security Notes

### Environment Variables
**NEVER** use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for:
- Database credentials (Redis, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- API keys with write access
- Secret tokens
- Authentication secrets

**ONLY** use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for:
- Public API endpoints
- Feature flags
- Analytics IDs (Google Analytics, etc.)
- Public configuration values

### Current Setup
All sensitive credentials are server-side only:
```env
# ✅ CORRECT - Server-side only
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=...
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=...

# ❌ WRONG - Would be exposed to browser
# NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=...
```

## 📊 Rate Limits

| Endpoint | Limit | Window |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `/api/claps` (increment) | 10 requests | 1 minute |
| `/api/post-detail` (increment) | 5 requests | 1 minute |
| Read operations | Unlimited | - |

## 🔧 Recommended Next Steps

### For Production
1. Consider using a proper rate limiting service (Upstash Rate Limit, Redis-based)
2. Add IP-based blocking for repeated abuse
3. Implement user-based clap limits in Redis (track per user)
4. Add CAPTCHA for suspicious activity
5. Monitor Redis usage and set up alerts

### For Better Security
1. Add request signing/HMAC verification
2. Implement CSRF protection
3. Add API key rotation mechanism
4. Set up security headers monitoring
5. Regular security audits
